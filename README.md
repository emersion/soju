[![builds.sr.ht status](https://builds.sr.ht/~emersion/soju/commits/master.svg)](https://builds.sr.ht/~emersion/soju/commits/master?)

soju is a user-friendly IRC bouncer. soju connects to upstream IRC servers on
behalf of the user to provide extra functionality. soju supports many features
such as multiple users, numerous [IRCv3] extensions, chat history playback and
detached channels. It is well-suited for both small and large deployments.

## Usage

* [Getting started]
* [Man page]

## Building and installing

Dependencies:

- Go
- BSD or GNU make
- a C89 compiler (optional, for SQLite)
- scdoc (optional, for man pages)

For end users, a `Makefile` is provided:

    make
    sudo make install

For development, you can use `go run ./cmd/soju` as usual.

To link with the system libsqlite3, set `GOFLAGS="-tags=libsqlite3"`. To disable
SQLite support, set `GOFLAGS="-tags=nosqlite"`.

To use an alternative SQLite library that does not require CGO, set `GOFLAGS="-tags=moderncsqlite"`.
